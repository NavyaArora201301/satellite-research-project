AIM- "Analyzing the Speed and Position of Satellites in the Earthâ€™s Orbits using Publically Available Data"
This project analyzes publicly available data on satellite positions and speeds to study orbital mechanics, collision risks, and explore the growing issue of space debris. 
Using dataset from Kaggle, this study explores Kessler Syndrome, orbital decay, and sustainable solutions for satellite management. 
The study includes data visualizations, methodologies, and potential mitigation strategies for a safer space environment.
